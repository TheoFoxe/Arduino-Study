I was working on the Arduino IDE before, but I have decided that I want to try to instead work on VSCode for a few reasons. 

1. More used to working on VSCode 
2. Would much rather use GitHub than the Arduino Cloud, and I'm not exactly sure if I can use GitHub from the Arduino IDE idk how that works 
3. Challenge myself to do something new hehe


EDIT: 6-27-2024

So it turns out I am not able to get the port recognized on vscode or something, and I can't seem to find the resources to help me on this specific issue. It's a little bit of a round-about way to save things onto github, but I will just store them into this folder and upload the folder to github that way hehe.

I was working on the Arduino IDE before, but I have decided that I want to try to instead work on VSCode for a few reasons. 

1. More used to working on VSCode 
2. Would much rather use GitHub than the Arduino Cloud, and I'm not exactly sure if I can use GitHub from the Arduino IDE idk how that works 
3. Challenge myself to do something new hehe
